title: Distributed Counter
---

This example walks you through building a basic distributed counter app, covering the full end-to-end flow connecting your Move code to your client app. The app allows you to create counters that anyone can increment, but only the owner can reset. This example assumes you already have a React App set with dApp Kit, and it's required `Providers` as described in [Client App with Sui TypeScript SDK](../first-app/client-tssdk.mdx).

{@include: ../../../snippets/info-pnpm-required.mdx}

If haven't followed Client App with Sui TypeScript SDK, run the following command in a terminal or console to scaffold a new app:

```bash
pnpm create @mysten/create-dapp --template react-client-dapp
```

To get a head start, you can automatically create this example using the following `template` value instead:

```bash
pnpm create @mysten/create-dapp --template react-e2e-counter
```

## Adding a Move module

The first element you need is a Move package to interact with. This example doesn't go in-depth on the Move code itself, but covers how to deploy it, and connect it to your dApp.

First, create a new `move` directory at the root of your project to place your Move code and then make it the active directory:

```bash
mkdir move
cd move
```

Next, use the [Sui Client CLI](references/cli/client.mdx) to generate a new Move package. If you have [Sui installed](guides/developer/getting-started/sui-install.mdx), the Sui CLI is on your system. Run the following command in your terminal or console:

```bash
sui move new counter
```

This creates a new, empty Move package in a new `move/counter` directory with a [Move.toml](references/move/move-toml.mdx) file, and an empty `sources` directory.

Add your Move code under `sources` by creating a new `counter.move` file:

{@inject: sdk/create-dapp/templates/react-e2e-counter/move/counter/sources/counter.move}

Now that you have your Move code, you need to publish it. The Client App with Sui TypeScript SDK example and the app template use `testnet` by default, so configure your code to match the network you want to deploy to.

First, update the Sui dependency in Move.toml by changing the `rev` from `framework/testnet` to `framework/devnet`.

```rust
...
[dependencies]
Sui = { git = "https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui.git", subdir = "crates/sui-framework/packages/sui-framework", rev = "framework/devnet" }
...
```

Next, configure the Sui CLI to use `devnet` as the active environment, as well. If you haven't already set up a `devnet` environment you can do so by running the following command in a terminal or console:

```bash
sui client new-env --alias devnet --rpc https://fullnode.devnet.sui.io:443
```

Run the following command to activate the `devnet` environment:

```bash
sui client switch --env devnet
```

Now, publish your Move code with the following command:

```bash
sui client publish --gas-budget 10000000 counter
```

:::info 

See [Sui Client CLI](/references/cli/client.mdx) for more information about `client` commands in the Sui CLI.

:::

The output of this command contains a `packageId` value that you need to save to use the package.

```bash
----- Object changes ----
Array [
    Object {
        ...
    },
    Object {
        ...
    },
    Object {
        "type": String("published"),
        "packageId": String("0xcd16d38ec30a4ad609336b51f6859a6b1014c50801b47845ac7a251e436cccf7"),
        "version": String("1"),
        "digest": String("4bCjupBDiaANmBySAtxuAdXEvGdKW4wrya6sbmRvynEe"),
        "modules": Array [
            String("counter"),
        ],
    },
]
----- Balance changes ----
```

Add the `packageId` value you receive in your own response to a new `constants.ts` file in your project:

```bash
export const COUNTER_PACKAGE_ID =
  "0xcd16d38ec30a4ad609336b51f6859a6b1014c50801b47845ac7a251e436cccf7";
```

## Creating a counter

Now that you've published your Move code, you can start building your UI to use your Move package. You need a way to create a new `Counter` object. Do this by creating a new `CreateCounter` component:

{@inject: sdk/create-dapp/templates/react-e2e-counter/src/createCounter.tsx#createCounter }

This component renders a button that enables the user to create a counter. Now, update your `create` function so that it calls the `create` function in your Move module.

To do this, you need to construct a `TransactionBlock`, with the appropriate `moveCall` transaction, and then sign and execute the programmable transaction block (PTB).

First, import `TransactionBlock` from `@mysten/sui.js`, `COUNTER_PACKAGE_ID` from your constants.ts file created previously, and `useSignAndExecuteTransactionBlock` from `@mysten/dapp-kit`.

{@inject: sdk/create-dapp/templates/react-e2e-counter/src/createCounter.tsx#imports}

Next, call the `useSignAndExecuteTransactionBlock` hook in your component, which provides a `mutate` function you can use in your `create` function:

{@inject: sdk/create-dapp/templates/react-e2e-counter/src/createCounter.tsx#createCounter}

Finally, construct your `TransactionBlock`:

{@inject: sdk/create-dapp/templates/react-e2e-counter/src/createCounter.tsx#create}

You now have a functional component that can create a new `Counter` object, but if you use it as is, you might run into some consistency issues where you successfully execute the `TransactionBlock`, but the data isn't yet indexed to read from an RPC node. To ensure the `TransactionBlock` is available, you can use the `waitForTransactionBlock` method of `SuiClient`.
To get an instance of `SuiClient`, you can use the `useSuiClient` hook from dApp Kit:

{@inject: sdk/create-dapp/templates/react-e2e-counter/src/createCounter.tsx#createCounterAbr}

Now you can use the `suiClient` in your `create` function to wait until the `TransactionBlock` is indexed:

{@inject: sdk/create-dapp/templates/react-e2e-counter/src/createCounter.tsx#createFull}

## Set up routing

Now that your users can create counters, you need a way to route to them. Routing in a React app can be complex, but this example keeps it basic. Set up your App so that you render the `CreateCounter` component by default, and if you want to display a specific counter you can put its ID into the hash portion of the URL.

{@inject: sdk/create-dapp/templates/react-e2e-counter/src/App.tsx}

This sets up your app to read the hash from the URL, and get the counter's ID if the hash is a valid object ID. Then, it either renders a `Counter` (which you define in the next step) if you have a counter ID, or the `CreateCounter` button from the previous step. When a counter is created, you update the URL, and set the counter ID.

## Building your counter user interface

For your counter, you want to display three elements:

- The current count, which you fetch from the object using the `getObject` RPC method.
- An increment button, which calls the increment Move function.
- A reset button, which calls the `set_value` Move function with `0`. This is only shown if the current user owns the counter.

{@inject: sdk/create-dapp/templates/react-e2e-counter/src/Counter.tsx#counter}

This snippet has a few new concepts to examine. It uses the `useSuiClientQuery` hook to make the `getObject` RPC call. This returns a data object representing your counter. dApp Kit doesn't know which fields your counter object has, so define a `getCounterFields` helper that gets the counter fields, and adds a type-cast so that you can access the expected `value` and `owner` fields in your component.

The code also adds an `executeMoveCall` function that still needs implementing. This works just like the `create` function you used to create the counter. Instead of using a callback prop like you did for `CreateCounter`, you can use the refetch provided by `useSuiClientQuery` to reload your `Counter` object after you've executed your PTB.

{@inject: sdk/create-dapp/templates/react-e2e-counter/src/Counter.tsx#executeMoveCall}

Your counter app is now ready to count. To learn more about dApp Kit, check out the [dApp Kit docs](https://sui-wallet-kit.vercel.app/dapp-kit).
