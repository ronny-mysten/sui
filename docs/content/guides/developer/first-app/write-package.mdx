title: Write a Move Package
description: The first step in getting a package on chain is to write the Move code that defines the logic of your package. The structure of a Move package is similar to those in Rust.
---

Before you can build a Move package and run its code, you must first [install Sui binaries](../getting-started/sui-install.mdx) for your operating system.

### Create the package

To begin, open a terminal or console at the location you plan to store your package. Use the `sui move new` command to create an empty Move package with the name `first_package`:

``` shell
sui move new first_package
```

Running the previous command creates a directory with the name you provide (`first_package`). The command populates the new directory with a skeleton Move project that consists of a `sources` directory and a `Move.toml` manifest file. Open the manifest with a text editor to review its contents:

```shell
cat first_package/Move.toml
```

If using the `cat` command, the console returns the following:

{@inject: examples/move/first_package/Move.toml}

### Defining the package

You have a complete Move package now, but it doesn't do anything. To make your package useful, you must add logic contained in `.move` source files that define *modules*. Use a text editor or the command line to create your first package source file named `example.move` in the `sources` directory of the package:

``` shell
touch first_package/sources/example.move
```

Populate the `example.move` file with the following code:

{@inject: examples/move/first_package/sources/example.move#initial}

The preceding code is basic but includes typical features of a typical Move source file. 

- **Imports:** Move allows your modules to use types and functions declared in other modules. You import these features into your own modules by way of the `use` directive. In this example, the module imports `object`, `transfer`, and `tx_content` modules. These modules are available to the package because the `Move.toml` file defines the Sui dependency (along with the `sui` named address) where they are defined.

- **Struct declarations:** Structs define types that a module can create or destroy. Struct definitions can include abilities provided with the `has` keyword. The structs in this example, for instance, have the `key` ability, which indicates that these structs are Sui objects that you can transfer between addresses. The `store` ability on the structs provides the ability to appear in other struct fields and you can transfer them freely.

- **Module initializer:** A special function (`fun init()`) that is invoked exactly one time upon module publication.
    
- **Accessor functions:** These functions (`magic()`, `strength()`, `swords_created()`) allow other modules to read the field values of this module's structs.

After you save the file, you have a complete Move package. 

In the next topic, you learn to build and test your package to get it ready for publishing.
